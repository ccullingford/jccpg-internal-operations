# Hierarchy of Authority

When drafting or interpreting documents, apply the following hierarchy:

    (Declaration, Articles, Bylaws, Rules)
2.  Applicable North Carolina statutes (when explicitly relevant)
3.  Company Knowledge (this document and other JCCPG standards)

If conflicts exist, follow the highest authority and note the conflict.

    process unless it conflicts with governing documents.
