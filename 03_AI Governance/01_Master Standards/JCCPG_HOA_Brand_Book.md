# JCC Property Group, Inc. (JCCPG) — HOA Brand Book (Draft)

> **Purpose:** Provide a single source of truth for voice, tone, messaging, and standards for all HOA-related communications, including content generated by custom GPTs.

---

## 1) Introduction & Purpose

### 1.1 Why this Brand Book Exists

At a high level, this brand book exists to provide a **consistent voice and messaging guidelines** for all HOA-related communication produced by **JCC Property Group, Inc.**

It also serves as a foundation for building and maintaining **standard operating procedures (SOPs)** and **standard answers** to common homeowner, board, and prospect questions. Over time, this reduces inconsistency, improves efficiency, and ensures that responses remain aligned with governing documents, policy, and best practices.

### 1.1A Source-of-Truth Hierarchy (What to Use When)

To keep enforcement, messaging, and guidance consistent across staff and custom GPT outputs, use this hierarchy when drafting any HOA communication (highest authority first). Each layer below includes what it is and what it usually governs.

1. **Federal, State, and Local Laws**
   - **What it is:** Statutes, regulations, ordinances, and case law that apply to associations, property, housing, and governance.
   - **Usually governs:** Owner rights, fair housing, debt collection/foreclosure rules, building/safety codes, elections requirements, record retention, notice requirements, and any legal limits on what an association can regulate.

2. **Recorded Plat/Map**
   - **What it is:** The recorded survey/plat showing property boundaries, common areas, easements, unit footprints, and (sometimes) limited common elements.
   - **Usually governs:** What is part of the unit vs. common element, boundary definitions, easements/access, and physical configuration—often critical for maintenance responsibility and repair disputes.

3. **Declaration of Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CC&Rs)**
   - **What it is:** The recorded declaration creating the association and establishing covenants, use restrictions, assessments, and core property obligations.
   - **Usually governs:** Use restrictions, maintenance responsibility, assessments/collections framework, architectural control, insurance allocations, enforcement authority, and community standards.

4. **Articles of Incorporation**
   - **What it is:** The legal document creating the association as a corporation (typically non-profit).
   - **Usually governs:** Corporate existence, basic powers, limitations, and foundational governance structure.

5. **Bylaws**
   - **What it is:** The internal governance rules for how the association operates.
   - **Usually governs:** Board/member meetings, elections, quorum/notice rules, officer roles, voting procedures, and administrative governance processes.

6. **Rules & Regulations / Adopted Policies (including board resolutions)**
   - **What it is:** Board-adopted rules, resolutions, and policies that implement the CC&Rs and clarify day-to-day standards.
   - **Usually governs:** Practical community rules (parking, pets, trash, amenities), enforcement procedures, fine schedules (if authorized), hearing processes, architectural guidelines, and operational policies.

7. **JCCPG SOPs and Standard Answers**
   - **What it is:** JCCPG’s internal procedures and standardized response language.
   - **Usually governs:** How we execute processes consistently (timelines, documentation, inspection cadence, extensions), and how we respond to common homeowner/board questions.

8. **Brand voice guidelines (how we say it)**
   - **What it is:** Communication standards for tone, structure, and wording.
   - **Usually governs:** Clarity, friendliness, confidence, reassurance, and precision in every message—without changing the underlying rule or authority.

**Rule:** When sources conflict, align to the highest authority before communicating. If unclear, escalate internally and/or to the board as needed.

### 1.1C Common Conflicts & How to Resolve Them (Standard Rules)

These are common real-world conflict patterns and how to resolve them using the hierarchy.

1. **Rules/Policies conflict with CC&Rs**
   - **Example:** A policy allows something the CC&Rs prohibit (or vice versa).
   - **Resolution rule:** CC&Rs control. Policies can clarify, but cannot override the CC&Rs.

2. **CC&Rs conflict with federal/state/local law**
   - **Example:** A covenant restricts something protected by law (e.g., fair housing requirements).
   - **Resolution rule:** Law controls. Do not enforce a covenant that conflicts with applicable law.

3. **Plat/Map conflicts with assumptions about unit vs common responsibility**
   - **Example:** A balcony/wall is assumed “unit,” but the plat/map defines it differently.
   - **Resolution rule:** Use plat/map to confirm boundaries, then confirm responsibility in the CC&Rs.

4. **Bylaws vs CC&Rs (governance vs property obligations)**
   - **Example:** Bylaws describe board process, while CC&Rs define enforcement rights.
   - **Resolution rule:** CC&Rs govern property obligations/enforcement; bylaws govern governance process.

5. **Rules are silent or unclear**
   - **Example:** A situation is not addressed specifically.
   - **Resolution rule:** Apply CC&Rs/general standards if applicable, then escalate to the board for clarification or policy creation.

6. **Owner disputes responsibility for a repair**
   - **Example:** Owner claims HOA must fix; HOA claims owner must fix.
   - **Resolution rule:** Confirm classification (unit/common/limited common) → apply CC&Rs → reference plat/map if needed → provide written guidance → escalate to board/legal if unclear and high risk.

7. **Emergency action vs authority**
   - **Example:** Active leak impacting multiple units/common elements but access authority is unclear.
   - **Resolution rule:** Prioritize safety/damage mitigation, document efforts, follow emergency provisions, and escalate to the board as needed.

**Standard communication rule for conflicts:**
- Do not speculate.
- Communicate what is known and what is being verified.
- Provide immediate mitigation steps if safety/damage is involved.
- Commit to a next update timing (e.g., “We will follow up by ___.”)

### 1.1B Where to Pull Language From (Practical Guidance)

- **Violations and rule enforcement:** Start with the association’s AppFolio Rules entry (rule name, short description, doc citation/quoted text, corrective action). Then apply the brand voice.
- **Process questions (timelines, inspections, extensions, hearings):** Use SOPs and Standard Answers.
- **Policy changes:** Use board-adopted policies first, then communicate proactively before enforcement.
- **Safety/damage events (leaks, hazards):** Use the After-Hours Protocol and the relevant SOP; prioritize mitigation and documentation.
