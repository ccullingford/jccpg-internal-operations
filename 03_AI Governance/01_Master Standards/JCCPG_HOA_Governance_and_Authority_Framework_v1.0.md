## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the authority hierarchy, enforcement standards, escalation rules, and conflict-resolution protocols governing HOA operations managed by JCC Property Group, Inc. (JCCPG).

It governs **what controls decisions** — not how communications sound.

This framework applies to:
- Board advisory guidance
- Enforcement actions
- Maintenance responsibility determinations
- Financial governance processes
- Emergency response
- AI-assisted drafting outputs related to HOA interpretation

## 2. Hierarchy of Authority (Source of Truth)

When drafting, advising, or enforcing, apply the following hierarchy in order:

1. Federal, State, and Local Law  
2. Recorded Plat / Map  
3. Declaration (CC&Rs)  
4. Articles of Incorporation  
5. Bylaws  
6. Rules & Regulations  
7. Board-Adopted Policies / Resolutions  
8. JCCPG Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)  
9. Brand & Voice Standards  

**Rule:** If sources conflict, the higher authority controls.

## 3. Conflict Resolution Standards

### 3.1 Rules vs CC&Rs
CC&Rs control. Policies may clarify but cannot override.

### 3.2 CC&Rs vs Law
Applicable law controls.

### 3.3 Plat vs Assumptions
Use the plat to confirm boundaries before determining responsibility.

### 3.4 Silence in Documents
Apply governing documents first. If unclear, escalate to the Board.

Prioritize safety and damage mitigation. Document all actions and escalate appropriately.
